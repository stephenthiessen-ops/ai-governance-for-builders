# Change Management for AI Systems

AI systems evolve differently than traditional software.

## Trigger Events for Review

- Prompt modification
- Model upgrade
- Expanded data scope
- External exposure change
- Risk tier change

## Required Actions

Tier 1:
- Log change
- Notify stakeholders

Tier 2:
- Change log entry
- Sample validation review

Tier 3:
- Formal reassessment
- Re-approval gate

## Monitoring

All AI systems require:

- Output quality sampling
- Drift detection
- Usage pattern monitoring

AI systems degrade silently without structured oversight.
